BEGIN_PGML
Are the folowing two numbers solutions of the equation [`[$lhs] = [$rhs]`]?

*  The number [`[$c1]`] [_]{$mc1} a solution of the equation.

*  The number [`[$c2]`] [_]{$mc2} a solution of the equation.

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
*  When we plug [`[$c1]`] in for [`x`] on the left hand side, we get [`[$lhs1]`], which [$ans1] equal to the right hand side.
   Therefore [`[$c1]`] [$ans1] a solution.

*  When we plug [`[$c2]`] in for [`x`] on the left hand side, we get [`[$lhs2]`], which [$ans2] equal to the right hand side.
   Therefore [`[$c2]`] [$ans2] a solution.
