## JSXGraph

- Figure out how to make all that into a module

### Inequalities

- in `updatePlaneAnswer`, try to figure out whether absolute value of slope is large or small. Then either first look 
  at Left/Right, or Up/Down.

## Rational equations

- Unify all existing so that they all say "enter None ..."
- Add some finding common denominator exercises (and reuse those for adding and
  subtracting expressions)
- Create step by step version of each exercise.
